# Yougori model API

Model: ${model.model}
API base URL: ${model.apiUrl}

${where} Keep Yougori and the model environment running; wait for Chat to report ready.

${credentials}

POST to /chat/completions under the base URL with Authorization: Bearer <key> and Content-Type: application/json. Any OpenAI-compatible client works when given this base URL and key. ${fields} Messages contain only role (system, user, assistant) and text content. Tool calling, images and other OpenAI fields are rejected.

Python example (standard library):

\`\`\`python
import json
import os
import urllib.request

payload = {
    "model": ${JSON.stringify(model.model)},
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "stream": False,
}
request = urllib.request.Request(
    ${JSON.stringify(`${model.apiUrl}/chat/completions`)},
    data=json.dumps(payload).encode("utf-8"),
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer " + ${keyExpression},
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
)
with urllib.request.urlopen(request, timeout=120) as response:
    result = json.load(response)
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
\`\`\`

Keep the request under 64 KiB, with at most 128 messages and 32,768 content characters. The model's context window may be smaller. The GPU serves one request at a time. For 401, check the key; for 429, wait and retry once; for a loading response, check Chat/startup logs before retrying. Shorten the conversation for context or GPU memory errors. Report persistent failures instead of looping.
